# First we can set the parameters to ONLY keep the sampled data as 
# there is no reason to make a copy of all the unsampled data. 
# In the process-pii pipeline there is a setting sample.keep_unsampled 
# which we can set to false which will then only keep the sampled data

        "field": "sample.keep_unsampled",
        "value": false <<< SET TO false
      }
    },

# Second we will create a pipeline that will reroute the data to the correct data stream 
# so that it will run through all the PII assessment / detection pipelines. 
# It also sets the correct dataset and namespace

# Finally we can run a `_reindex` to select the data we want to test / assess.  
# First select the source data stream you want to assess, in this example it is the 
# `logs-generic-default` logs data stream. Note I also added a `range` filter to 
# select a specific time range. There is a bit of a "trick" that we need to use 
# since we are re-routing the data to the data stream `logs-pii-default`. 
# To do this, we just set `"index": "logs-tmp-default"` in the `_reindex` as 
# the correct data stream will be set in the pipeline. We need to do that because 
# `reroute` is a `noop` if it is called from / to the same datastream.
